tail -n 100 /var/log/application.log

 Verify infrastructure components (load balancers, databases, APIs)
 Check network connectivity and DNS resolution
 Validate authentication/authorization services
 Test critical business workflows
 Review error rates and performance metrics


CONTAINMENT (if security incident)
